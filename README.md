## Yasmin Green

I am a former forensic scientist, and am excited to start career as a web developer with a drive for learning. I recently completed bootcamp at Makers Academy going from only knowing the very basics of the Ruby language to building fully functional websites with multiple coding languages and frameworks in twelve weeks.

## Skills

#### Communication and approachability MAKE MORE PERSONAL*********

Communication is incredibly important and I am confident in communicating my thoughts whether it be revealing that I do not understand something, something I feel like my team or I could improve on, or areas that went well. In addition I try to encourage my team members to communicate more by giving them a safe space to talk about their thoughts.

One of the core fundamentals taught at Makers Academy is pair programming and everyday I was pairing with a different person. To ensure that my pair partner had the best pairing experience with myself, multiple times during the day I would encourage feedback sessions asking if there was anything in particular I could improve on to better their experience.

#### Fast learner

For the Makers Academy final project five weeks into learning JavaScript, I completed a project in full stack JavaScript including Angular, Node.js and Express. Node.js and Express was not taught on the course and I managed to learn and build a fully functioning website using those frameworks within two weeks. This project can be found [here](https://github.com/yasgreen93/social-calendar.git).

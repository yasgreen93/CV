## Yasmin Green

I am a former forensic scientist, and am excited to start career as a web developer with a drive for learning. I recently completed bootcamp at Makers Academy going from only knowing the very basics of the Ruby language to building fully functional websites with multiple coding languages and frameworks in twelve weeks.

## Skills

#### Mentoring

Makers Academy has a mentoring system where the people in the latter part of the course are given a mentee to guide along the process. I thoroughly enjoyed being a mentor as I love helping people. I really like helping someone understand a concept and to see them get excited when the cogs suddenly click into place, the lightbulb switches on and the smile appears on their face! After offering my help multiple times to many people I found myself being approached again and again. This made me really happy in that I could offer more help but more importantly that they felt I gave good enough advice for them to ask me again.

#### Fast learner

For the Makers Academy final project five weeks into learning JavaScript, I completed a project in full stack JavaScript including Angular, Node.js and Express. Node.js and Express was not taught on the course and I managed to learn and build a fully functioning website using those frameworks within two weeks. This project can be found [here](https://github.com/yasgreen93/social-calendar.git).

#### Attention to detail

A fundamental skill of being a forensic scientist is attention to detail and having to analyse

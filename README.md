I am a former Forensic Scientist, and am excited to a start career as a web developer with a drive for learning. I attended Makers Academy studying web development as I love being creative and solving problems. In those twelve weeks I developed a passion in clean test-driven code, object-orientated design, Nutella and ping pong. I am searching for a junior developer job with opportunities to learn, a fun atmosphere and some more ping pong.

#### Mentoring

I thoroughly enjoyed the mentoring system at Makers Academy. I loved helping my mentee understand a concept and to see them get excited when the cogs suddenly click into place, the lightbulb switches on and the smile appears on their face! After offering my help multiple times to many people I found myself being approached again and again. This made me really happy in that I could offer more help but more importantly that they felt I gave good enough advice for them to ask me again.

#### Fast learner

For the Makers Academy final project five weeks into learning JavaScript, I completed a project in full stack JavaScript including Angular, Node.js and Express. Node.js and Express was not taught on the course and I managed to learn and build a fully functioning website using those frameworks within two weeks. This project can be found [here](https://github.com/yasgreen93/social-calendar.git).

#### Attention to detail

A fundamental skill of being a forensic scientist is analysing the smallest amount of evidence and extracting a large amount of information from it. I perceive situations from multiple perspectives in which other people may not see. This allows me to ask difficult questions as I am naturally inquisitive, and this helps me to get to the core of the problem.

## <a name="Hobbies">Hobbies and interests</a>

One of my biggest passions is music. I have had lessons in the piano and trumpet and have taught myself the guitar. I also enjoy making my own instrumental music.

A second interest is sport, in particular hockey and tennis. I have played hockey for the 1st team at university and at the schools I attended.

In 6 weeks I organised a disordered music library of 4000+ records, a project that had been stalled for an extensive period of time.

I worked part time cleaning out the kennels as well as feeding, walking and most importantly cuddling the dogs.
